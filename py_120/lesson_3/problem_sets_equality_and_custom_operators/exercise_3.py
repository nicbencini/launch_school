"""
Using the answer to the previous problem, create the methods needed so you can perform ordered comparisons of Cat objects by their name value. 
As with the previous problem, the comparison should ignore case. They should work for the <, <=, >, and >= operators. If the right-hand operand is not a Cat object, 
the methods should return NotImplemented.

Be sure to write test cases to demonstrate that your methods work as intended.
