"""
Update this class so you can use it to determine the lowest ranking and highest ranking cards in a list of Card objects:

For this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2 through 10. Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks, Kings are higher than Queens, 
nd Aces are higher than Kings. The suit plays no part in the relative ranking of cards.

If you have two or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min and max methods should return one of the matching cards; it doesn't matter which one.

Besides any methods needed to determine the lowest and highest cards, create a __str__ method that returns a string representation of the card, e.g., 
"Jack of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.

Problem:
    - Update the Card class so that it can be used to determine the lowest ranking and highest ranking cards in a list of card objects.
    - Create a string method that returns a string representation of the card

Rules:
    - Numeric cards are low cards ordered from 2 through 10
    - Ace > King > Queen > Jack
    - Suit plays no part in ranking
    - if two cards are of the same rank then return any one
