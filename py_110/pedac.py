        rules:
          Explicit requirements:
            - Every palindrome in the string must be converted to uppercase.
              (Reminder: a palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards
              and backward).
            - Palindromes are case sensitive. ("dad" is a palindrome, but "Dad" is not.)

          Implicit requirements:
            - If the string is an empty string, the result is an empty string.
