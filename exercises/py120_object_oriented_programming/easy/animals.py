"""
The Cat initializer should accept 3 parameters: name, age, and status. Cats should always have a leg count of 4 and a species of "cat". 
The introduce method for the Cat class should return a string identical to the base class with an added Meow meow! at the end. For example:

The Dog initializer should accept 4 parameters: name, age, status, and owner. Dogs should always have a leg count of 4 and a species of "dog". 
In addition to the methods inherited from Animal, the Dog class should have a greet_owner method that returns a greeting to its owner followed by Woof! Woof!. 
The introduce method for the Dog class should return a string identical to the base class with an added Woof! Woof! at the end.
